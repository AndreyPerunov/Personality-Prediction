# 🧠 Personality Prediction

This project explores personality type prediction using three different machine learning approaches implemented in Python:

- 🔍 **Logistic Regression**
- 🌳 **Decision Tree**
- 🤖 **Multilayer Neural Network**

## 📁 About the Project

The goal is to classify individuals as **Extroverts** or **Introverts** based on a [personality_dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakeshkapilavai/extrovert-vs-introvert-behavior-data/data) dataset. The dataset consists of 2,900 entries with 8 input features.

## 📓 Google Colab Notebook

You can open and run the project directly in Google Colab:

## 🔄 Data Preprocessing

Before training the models, the dataset is being preprocessed to ensure data quality and improve model performance.

Following procedures were performed:

1. Filling in Missing Values
2. Converting Features to Numeric Values
3. Scaling the Data
   - Normalization
   - Standardization
